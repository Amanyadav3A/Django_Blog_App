I developed a Django Blog Application as a comprehensive project to 
deepen my understanding of Django and Django REST Framework. This 
web application allows users to create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
Once authenticated, users can create, update, and delete their blog posts, providing 
full control over their content. Additionally, I implemented interactive features such
as likes and comments on posts, enabling users to engage with each otherâ€™s content.

For the backend, I utilized Django for robust server-side logic and Django REST Framework 
to build a scalable and efficient API. On the frontend, I used Jinja templates for dynamic
rendering, along with JavaScript, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive and visually appealing 
user interface.

The primary goal of this project was to explore and master key concepts of Django and Django REST Framework,
including user authentication, CRUD operations, database management, and API integration. Through this project,
I gained hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application, from backend development to frontend design.
